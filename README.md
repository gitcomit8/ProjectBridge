# ProjectBridge - Android Application

## Overview

ProjectBridge is an Android marketplace designed to seamlessly connect clients (individuals needing assistance with academic projects and assignments) with talented student freelancers ready to take on those tasks. This platform streamlines the process of posting project requirements by clients and enables freelancers to claim projects on a first-come, first-served basis. Payments are securely managed through a split system: an initial 50% upfront payment via a UPI payment gateway, with the remaining 50% released upon confirmation of hardcopy delivery by platform administrators. A transparent 10% service charge is applied to each transaction, supporting the platform's operation.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the application's features, a detailed explanation of the dynamic pricing algorithm employed, and essential setup instructions for developers interested in contributing under the terms of the MIT License.

    * **Platform Analytics:** Insights into platform usage, transaction volumes, and user activity.

## Pricing Algorithm

ProjectBridge utilizes a sophisticated algorithm to dynamically determine the price of each project, ensuring fairness and reflecting the effort and urgency involved. The calculation is based on the following factors:

**Base Price (BP):** â‚¹50 (This serves as the starting point for a project of standard characteristics: approximately 700 words, basic complexity, within a general subject area, with a deadline exceeding 7 days, and without specific specialized skills).

The final project price is calculated using the following multi-step formula:


Price = (BP * CM * SM * DM * WCF(WC)) * (1 + (SS_software * 0.10) +(SS_analysis * 0.15) +(SS_domain * 0.20)) * 1.10
**Explanation of the Components:**

1.  **BP (Base Price):** The initial starting cost for a standard project.

2.  **CM (Complexity Multiplier):** Adjusts the price based on the perceived difficulty of the project:

    * Basic: 1.0
    * Intermediate: 1.2
    * Advanced: 1.5
3.  **SM (Subject Multiplier):** Accounts for the specialization and demand of different academic subjects:

    * General Subjects (e.g., English, History): 1.0
    * Technical Subjects (e.g., Computer Science, Engineering): 1.3
    * Specialized Subjects (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Biotechnology): 1.6
4.  **DM (Deadline Multiplier):** Reflects the urgency of the project completion:

    * > 7 Days: 1.0
    * 3-7 Days: 1.2
    * < 3 Days: 1.5
    * Same Day: 2.0
5.  **WCF(WC) (Word Count Factor):** Modifies the price based on the estimated length (in words) of the project:

    ```
    WCF(WC) =
        if WC <= 300 then 0.5
        else if 301 <= WC <= 500 then 0.8
        else if 501 <= WC <= 700 then 1.0
        else if 701 <= WC <= 1000 then 1.3
        else if 1001 <= WC <= 1500 then 1.6
        else 2.0 + (WC - 1500) * 0.00014
    ```
6.  **Specific Skills Adjustment:** This component increases the price if the project requires specialized skills:

    * **SS\_software:** If the project requires specific software proficiency, the price is increased by 10% (multiplier of 1.10). (Value is 1 if required, 0 otherwise)
    * **SS\_analysis:** If the project demands advanced statistical analysis, the price is increased by 15% (multiplier of 1.15). (Value is 1 if required, 0 otherwise)
    * **SS\_domain:** If the project necessitates specialized domain knowledge (e.g., legal research), the price is increased by 20% (multiplier of 1.20). (Value is 1 if required, 0 otherwise)
7.  **Service Charge:** Finally, a 10% service charge is added to the calculated price to support the platform's operations (multiplied by 1.10).
